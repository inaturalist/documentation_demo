# Documentation Demo

This is a demo for how we could use Github to manage our documentation for iNaturalist.

Any `.md` files created in the the `docs` folder in this repo can be viewed by constructing a url with `https://inaturalist.github.io/documentation_demo/docs/` plus the name of the file plus `html` such as:
https://inaturalist.github.io/documentation_demo/docs/table_of_contents.html
